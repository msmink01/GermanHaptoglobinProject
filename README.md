# Haptoglobin-Project
### Moniek Smink, June - August 2019
### Worked with Dr. Miel Hostens; University of Utrecht
--------

Linear mixed modeling analysis done on dataset consisting of more than 60 clinical parameters of German dairy cattle (n = 712). The purpose of this project was to identify associations between serum haptoglobin and precursors for infections (such as body temperature, serum BHBA, serum NEFA, etc.). Results were reported in a github repository containing statistical model tables, data visualizations, and explanations. Analysis was done in R Version 4.0.2; graphs were created in Tableau. 

--------
### Files included:

 - **Introduction.md**: File containing introductory changes and formatting applied to the data before it was analyzed. 
 - **DescriptiveStatistics.md**: File containing descriptive statistics for each clinical parameter of interest.
 - **BiVariableStatistics.md**: File containing outcomes of bivariable linear models for haptoglobin as the outcome variable and different clinical parameters as the independent variable.
 - **Correlogram.md**: File containing details of creating and interpreting the correlogram made for the clinical parameters to prevent overshadowing in the multiple variable models.
 - **MultiVariableStatistics.md**: File containing different multiple variable linear models created based on the outcomes of the bivariable analysis using backward-step elimination. 
 - **Multivariate.rmd**: R-Markdown file containing multiple variable linear models created later solely for publication purposes.
